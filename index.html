								<p>
									I currently live in Taipei, Taiwan, where I work as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the
									Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA). At ASIAA I mainly work
									with Nagayoshi Ohashi and Sienny Shang on ALMA observations of protostellar sources.
									I got my PhD from the university of Hawaii at Manoa, where I worked with Michael Connelley
									and Bo Reipurth. During this time, I also worked with Jonathan Williams and Adwin Boogert
									on shorter scales research projects. In 2014 I graduated with a Bachelor of Science from Universidad
									de Chile.</p>
								<p>I consider myself as a very active person whom likes playing sports, trying new things, and
									always wants to learn somehing new. Some of the activities I have enjoyed in my life are Salsa and
									bachata dancing, learning mandarin Chinese, snorkeling, contact sports such as Taekwondo and Kick Boxing. I
									really enjoy teaching, I have been a physics and math instructor for many years, and I even attempted
									teaching lating dance classes.
								    </p>
								<p> I got interested in science and astronomy when I was in high school. I was absolutely
									fascinated wih the mysteries of the universe, and I thought that uncovering those mysteries
								was the coolest thing ever. Although I was mostly attracted by the math and physcis behind these
							phenomenon, I have recently gotten very interested in the beauty of observational astronomy.

								<h2 class="major">Research</h2>
								<p>My research interest are mainly star and planet formation. I would like to understand
								the effects of magnetic fields in low-mass young stars and how the star and the disk affect
							  each other at the earliest stages of planet formation. </p>

								<h3 class="major">Star formation and evolution</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/HindsVariable.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p> Stars younger than 1 Myr old are often called protostar, these stars are so embeded in their birth material
								that they can sometimes only be accessed thorugh IR observations. I am interested in characterizing the stellar
								properties of these stars such as temperature and gravity which allow us to indirectly learn about their masses
								and ages. </p>
								<h3 class="major">Magnetic fields</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/magnetic_field_and_disk.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> Magnetic fields play a fundamental role in the formation and evolution of stars. These are,however,
									often poorly understood and characterize. I have conducted measurements of magnetic fields in a sample of
									~100 low-mass young stars, which will allow us to understand how the magnetic field change as the star evolve
								from the highly embedded protostellar phase to the much older gas-starved phase. This research, could shed lights
							  into the changes that stars themselves experience as they contract and evolve towards the main-sequence phase.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Protoplanetary disks</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/protoplanetary_disks.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Protoplanetary disks are the birthsite of planets. They are proven to be highly complex when observed at sufficient
								spatial resolution which could be itself a signpost of ongoing planet formation. I have performed hydrodynamical and
								radiative transfer simulations of protoplanetary disk with the goal of understanding how planet formation looks-like
								in real data, but also to understand the protoplanetary disk itself.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Atmospheric telluric correction</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/earth_amospheric_transparency.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The earth atmosphere is opaque at discrete and continuous wavelengths thought the electromagnetic spectrum.
									At IR wavelength it is customary to observe the so called A0 telluric standard stars to partially alliviate
									the discrete flux reduction seen in the observed science spectra. As part of my job at the NASA Infrared Telescope
									I helped to build a code that produces model spectra of the Earth’s transmission which reduce the need for taking
									spectra of telluric standard stars. The process of producing synthetic atmospheric spectra has as ultimate goal
									to incease the efficiency of the observatory by collecting more science spectra during the night and performed
									the subsequent callibrations during the day.</p>

													iSHELL K-band Survey of Class I and Flat Spectrum Sources:
													Magnetic field measurements in the protostellar phase (2024, submitted) </strong></li>
												<span class="image main"><img src="images/Flores2024-fig1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
												<p> We performed the first magnetic field strength survey of Class I and Flat Spectrum (FS) sources using
												K-band observations with iSHELL. We model the photospheric absorption lines of
											34 Class I and FS sources and measure their magnetic field strengths, K-band temperatures, and gravities.
										  We put the physical properties of Class I and FS sources in context by comparing them to the values derived
											for a sample of Class II sources. As shown in the image, the average gravity of Class I and FS objects
											is lower than the average gravity of Class II sources, however, a significant overlap between both gravity
											distributions exist. Using evolutionary models we show that the average gravity of Class I and FS sources is
										 0.6 Myrs, significantly younger than the average age of Class II sources of 3 Myrs. Also, the average magnetic field
										 strength of Class I and FS sources 〈B〉 = 1.8 ± 0.10 kG is comparable to the average magnetic field of Class II sources.
									   Our results confirm that protostellar sources host strong magnetic fields on their photospheres and they likely accrete
										 disk material through a magnetosphere similar to their more evolved T Tauri counterparts.</p>

													Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). XII. Accretion Streamers, Protoplanetary Disk,
													and Outflow in the Class I Source Oph IRS 63 (2023 ApJ) </strong></li>
												<span class="image main"><img src="images/Flores2023-new-fig.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
												<p> We present ALMA observations of the Class I source Oph IRS63 in the context of the Early Planet
													Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) large program. Our ALMA observations of Oph IRS63 show
													a myriad of protostellar features, such as a shell-like bipolar outflow (in 12CO), an extended rotating
													envelope structure (in 13CO), a streamer connecting the envelope to the disk (in C18O), and several
													small-scale spiral structures seen towards the edge of the dust continuum (in SO). On the left image, I show
												the beatiful outflow detected in CO, which shows shell-like structures. On the right image, I show a very
											intriguing spiral and ring-like structure detected in SO.</p>

												The Effects of Starspots on Spectroscopic Mass Estimates of Low-mass Young Stars (2022 ApJ) </strong></li>
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/Flores2022-Fig1.png" alt="" /></span>
											<p>Magnetic fields and mass accretion processes create dark and bright spots on the surface of young stars.
												These spots manifest as surface thermal inhomogeneities, which alter the global temperature measured on the stars.
												To understand the effects and implications of these starspots, we conducted a large iSHELL high-resolution infrared
												 spectroscopic survey of T Tauri stars in Taurus-Auriga and Ophiuchus star-forming regions. Our main results
												 are that 1) there is a systematic temperature difference between optical and infrared observation (left panel)
											 and 2) that a positive correlation between our measured magnetic field strengths and the temperature differences (right panel).
										  The discrepant temperature measurements imply significant differences in the inferred stellar masses for these young stars.
											In this article paper, we use results from ALMA observations to discern which temperature is really tracing the effetive
											temperature of these largely spotted stars.</p>

												The Anatomy of an Unusual Edge-on Protoplanetary Disk. II: Gas temperature and a warm outer region (2021 AJ) </strong></li>
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/TRD_temperature_12CO_and_13CO_new_beams.png" alt="" /></span>
											<p>We present high-resolution 12CO and 13CO 2 - 1 ALMA observations of the highly-inclined protoplanetary disk
												around SSTC2D J163131.2-242627. We apply a modified version of the Topographically Reconstructed
												Distribution method presented by Dutrey et al. (2017) to derive the temperature structure of the disk.
												CO is clearly detected from two surface layers separated by a midplane region in which CO emission is suppressed,
												as expected from freeze-out in the cold midplane. Outside of R > 200 au, the midplane temperature of the disk increases
												with a nearly vertically isotermal profile. The transition in CO temperature coincides in position with
												a dramatic reduction in the sub-micron and sub-millimeter emission from the disk. We interpret this
												phenomenon as interstellar UV radiation providing an additional source of heating to the outer part
												of the disk.

												Is T Tauri North a "Classical" T Tauri Star? (2020 ApJ)</a></strong></li>
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/HRD_Feiden_magnetic_combined_figure_in_blue_200505.png" alt="" /></span>
											<p>We present high-resolution H- and K-band spectroscopic observations of the archetypal T Tauri star T Tau North.
											We find that the IR temperature derived from our work is ~800 K cooler than optical temperature derived in the literatture.
											This temperature difference is interpreted as cool or hot spots, or both, covering a significant part of the surface of T Tau N. The gravity derived
											for T Tau N is lower than the gravity of nearly every other star in a sample of 24 classical
											T Tauri stars in Taurus. Combining these temperature and gravity results with magnetic stellar evolutionary
											models, we find the age of T Tau N to be less than 1 Myr old. These results suggest that T Tau N is in an earlier
											evolutionary stage than most classical T Tauri stars in Taurus, arguing that it is a protostar ejected from the
											embedded southern binary system shortly after its formation.</p>

												Young Stars Using iSHELL Observations: BP Tau and V347 Aur (2019 ApJ)</a></strong></li>
												<span class="image main"><img src="images/BP_Tau_and_V347_Aur.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
												<p>We present stellar parameters and magnetic field strength measurements of BP Tau and V347 Aur, both young stars
													observed with the near-infrared spectrograph iSHELL. For BP Tau, we measure a surface magnetic field strength of
													2.5 kG literature results. For this star, however, we obtain a much lower temperature value than previous optical studies
													(dT~ 400 K) and interpret this significant temperature difference as due to the relatively higher impact of
													starspots at near-infrared wavelengths than at optical wavelengths. We further apply this technique to the class I
													protostellar source V347 Aur and measure for the first time its magnetic field strength of 1.35 kG
													and its surface gravity log g= 3.25. Lastly, we combine our measurements with pre-main-sequence stellar
													evolutionary models and illustrate the effects produced by starspots on the retrieved masses and ages of young
													stars.</p>
